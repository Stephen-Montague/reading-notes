I've joined [Code Fellows](https://codefellows.org/) for the next few months to meet wonderful people and get up to speed with Full Stack Web Development, and this site is for my reading notes and serves as a place to practice.  Feel free to browse my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Stephen-Montague) or to talk about projects and other ideas [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-w-montague/)(LinkedIn).

Happy Coding.  :smiley:
