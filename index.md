This is a "GitHub Pages" site built via this [repository](https://github.com/Stephen-Montague/reading-notes/) to begin Web Development at [Code Fellows](https://codefellows.org/).  While I have some experience in programming, Full Stack development hasn't been my focus until now, so I look forward to this journey.

## Growth Mindset

Code Fellows follows an intense program of study and practice, but in the first days, we also make a quick assessment of our mindset - here named a "Growth Mindset."  So what is a this?  To me, it's finding balance in all, most likely with daily effort, to do 2 things:

1. Accept some limits
2. Push some limits  

Obivously, these 2 are opposed, hence why we always need to find some healthy, happy balance.  Health and happiness, action and rest - there's much to balance in any course of study.  

## Markdown Demo

To demo more Markdown, here's a few quotes with competing ideas held by the same person.

### George S. Patton 1885â€“1945

> Take calculated risks. That is quite different from being rash.  
> *6 June 1944*
>  
> A good plan violently executed Now is better than a perfect plan next week.  
> *1947*

[Oxford Quotations](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00016315)

Just for the record, since this is a post where people may just be meeting me - I don't romanticize Patton or warfare to the degree that some have - careful balance is needed for all of our life stories.  

We're all human, right? :robot::alien: Now, let's continue.
