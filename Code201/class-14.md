## CSS Transforms

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

    Tranform allows for apparent changes to a displayed object's location, rotation, or scale.

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

    Movement is great to attract attention, so to highlight an important next step or key point, a tastefully applied transform, to stretch or jiggle an element could be very useful for communication. It's a good tool, but I would be careful to avoid excessive movement.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

    This allows us to select properties that will change via a transition, with a duration and timing function for the ratio of change, under specified conditions, like for cursor hover.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

    Animations property changes and timing (via percent keyframes or easing) are declared seperately, and so may be used by multiple elements.  Animations also allow more control, like over how many times a change happens, including animations on an "infinite" loop.

    It's a great tool in the toolbox for making a site look attractive and intuitive. It even adds a security benefit in potentially cutting out the need for JavaScript.

## Things I Want to Know More About

  I did experiment with CSS animations already, but if I was doing a lot of front-end work, it would be useful to be more familiar with these tools.  I'm also curious how far others have gone to use these tools in an advanced manner, how performant these tricks are, how extensive browser support has become, and about industry norms for this.
