## HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

    An anchor element is used create a basic link.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

    According to MDN the href "creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address." Good stuff - I didn't realize it can even be used for the "mail to" link of an email address.

3. How can we ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

    Make sure to add text to accurately describe the links.

## CSS

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow vs. CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

    Top to bottom, left to right, blocking out each designated area.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

    Block level elements block out an area to the left and right, inline allows horizontal stacking.

3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

    Absolute positioning is relative to the parent container, so given no other parent than the body or root, absolute positioning allows you to set the exact location of any element in direct relation to the whole page, or to a specif parent element.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

  Fixed positioning is relative to the viewport - it does not scroll with the page, unlike absolute positioning, which is relative to the page or some parent element.

## JS

### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

    The declaration denotes that a function exists, with a name and possibly input parameters. The definition scripts what the function does and whether it returns anything - and hovering over the declaration in an IDE will likely inform you of the inputs and outputs. The invocation sends parameters if necessary and begins the function's actual processing.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

    A parameter is what the function takes.  
    An argument is what is sent to the function.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

    Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

  The ability to think and talk about code well would likely translate well into some coding interview styles, where the interviewer wants to talk about a problem and possible solution before coding, if coding at all.

  Moroever, an increased ability to plan and talk about code with another person over the internet is probably good training for a potential remote work situation.  
  
  It could even come in handy later in a career if mentoring, teaching, or supervising - being able to communicate in many different ways can't hurt for any of these situations.

## Things I Want To Know More About

  Sorry to be repetitive, but I can't think about much more than getting a few hours sleep right now. I'm not sure why, but all these assignments have consumed a lot of time, and I suspect the lack of sleep is making me take even longer, so it's a bit of vicious circle.  Anyway, time management and finding worthwhile shortcuts is worth its weight in gold if I can improve on this.
