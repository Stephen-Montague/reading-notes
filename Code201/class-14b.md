## Psych Safety

I read this article [What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html).  I'm not going to format my notes today - just going to paste them in, since there's too much to say in too little time, but I will divide by the article main points, versus some of the thoughts brought up in comments.  

## Article Points

1. Collective intelligence is highest when everyone contributes.

2. Reading others, social sensitivity, conversational turn take - make a good team, add to collective intelligence.

    (Otherwise, you are just operating as many individuals, which is fine for individual-level work, but bad for work that needs a strong group.)

3. Psych Safety - if a team is safe for risk-taking, based on mutual trust and respect, it encourages creativity and thereby productivity.

4. Enthusiam for other's ideas, joking around and having fun - traits of a healthy team.

5. Clear goals, being dependable - other important aspects

6. "Now they had to find a way to make communication and empathy — the building blocks of forging real connections — into an algorithm they could easily scale." - oh, god.

    (Sorry for the light explicitive above - just felt the need to react.)

7. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

Researching team dynamics is a great past time, except when it yields nothing new.  Three years of research and they found:  “...Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known.”  And the article’s conclusion spins the analysis paralysis into something positive – basically, that techies needs data; which translates into – techies go to extraordinary measures to avoid dealing with the messy people stuff.  Researching is a great way to avoid taking action when all options appear to be uncomfortable.  Project Aristotle is also a reminder about the fact that research and data is nice and fun, but taking action on it is much harder and acting is what makes the difference.

Is it me or is this a project that spent three years and millions? to find out that different groups of people function differently and that you can't always tell what is going to make one group successful and another not because people are so varied and the dynamic is always different? And that the things that seem to work are kind of vague and all the things we learned in kindergarten stuff - caring, patience, communication, empathy? Maybe I missed something, but it didn't seem like it to me.

Team vs individual work - defining this is a difficult balance.

---

"Love one another." - works best at home and work.

---

"VULNERABILITY - this is they key word that is missing from this article... empathy, vulnerability and trust."

---

National culture differences... would these findings work in all human contact, or just in the USA?

---

I do think that what Google has shown to be best for teams may be very uncomfortable for [some, non-group oriented people] and make those individuals less productive.  It may be that the best solution is to have people who work best in teams work in teams, and to give those who do not work well in teams as much independence as possible and allow them to work alone with only occasional contact with the team.

This is like...

"I'm o.k., you're o.k." - the 1960's version of defining good teamwork.

Nope to all this.... Meetings with not much to actually accomplish so the chest thumping thing or, alternatively, the touchy feely time starts.
In my opinion (experience) in a real working meeting people know what to do and what to talk about and get it done so they can get back to work. 

---

Sadly, this article makes no mention of professional facilitating. The Skilled Facilitator, by Roger Schwartz is a great introduction.

---

Not everything is group work. Making work excessively group or individual oriented - either is a mistake.

---

From experience, team building is part of the tool-set in corporate politics: Teams are build to deflect blame and team are disbanded to hoard success.

So you're telling me that after all is said and done, the most productive groups turn out to be touchy-feely liberal PC "safe spaces"? HAHAHAHA

---

Negativity - are some people group toxic?

---

Try to make any norms explicit.

## Things I Want to Know More About

Too much here already, but I could definitely converse about this more. Those comment clips were hand-selected of many, many more. I don't agree with all of them, but they do all make me think.  Now I better move on.
