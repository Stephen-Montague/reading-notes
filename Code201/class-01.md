# Code 201 - Reading 1

## Required Notes

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

    I'd like to get it,  
    I'd like to send it,  
    And here it is.

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.  

    According to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Parse):  

    ''The browser parses HTML into a DOM tree. HTML parsing involves tokenization and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values.''

    By order - the HTML is parsed first, and sources like images are loaded asynchonously, but scripts (usually JavaScript) encountered will pause HTML parsing unless directed otherwise, and then finally, CSS is applied.

3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
    Besides your own images, sites like Unsplash have high quality images free to use commercially, and in a draft stage, there are sites with free filler images. Google images, when set to a Creative Commons license, and sites like Wikimedia are other possible sources, but in any case, you must be careful to have the rights to publish.

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
    - Numbers use numerals and optionally decimals, like 2.
    - Strings use single or double quotes, like "2".

    I tend to use double quotes to make inner quotes within a string easier to read, using inner single quotes rather than escape characters.  

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

Variables can store data that changes - without it, implementing any change via a script would be much more difficult or even, in practically terms, impossible.

## Required - What I Want to Know More About

Everything? No seriously, though, since we're pretty early in the full-stack web dev journey, I'll stick to the core documents and vanilla methods first, but I would like to dive soon into common industry frameworks and coding practices.
