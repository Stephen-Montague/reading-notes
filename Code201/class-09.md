### HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?

    Forms are how to capture and display user keyboard input.  

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

    Keep in mind user expectations, standard styling.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

    Input box (for single line), text area (for multiple lines), button (for click / press / hover events), fieldset (for limited mutliple choice bubbles), select (typically a dropdown list menu of options) - all things we need to input any kind of data.

JS Events.

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

    Events are things that happen in code that can trigger other things to happen.  They greatly help to decouple code, so that one piece of code doesn't need the details of another piece of code to operate - it just listens for the appropriate events.

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

    The event type to listen for, and a callback function, name of the function or object to call.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

    Will get back to this question.

4 .What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

    Will get back to this question.
