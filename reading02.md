### Reading 2 - To Review Essentials

So most of the readings (on using a console, introducing an IDE, and describing file systems) are a review for me.

I did like this quote from our course text on "Choosing a Text Editor."

```
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
```

This is a good description, as some of these features get missed by newcomers.  In fact, there are more, related parts of an IDE.  
The compiler, for example, might need other software tools to build / package the final product. 

The debugger, in particular, is a tool that I'd like to grow more skills with, as the need and opportunity arises.  I've used debuggers some, but I expect debugging a commercial codebase is a very different matter than using a debugger on personal projects.

Time to move on - thanks for reading. ðŸ™‚
