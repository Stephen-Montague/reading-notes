# Reading 8 - Getting Loopy

JavaScript continues to set itself apart from other C family languages with some loop and iterator syntax.  I'm glad to see the old "for loop" is alive and well, along with "while" (and for better or worse "do... whilee").  I felt it was a shame not to get a familiar for-each syntax, but I suspect the "for...in" and "for...of" syntax is related, although the docs point out that they are **not** equivalent.  There's a near-endless supply of supportive libraries as well, but I'll steer clear of most of these until I survey the road ahead.  Another unique aspect of JavaScript is the treatment of "const", which differs from both const-loving C++ and const-defying Python.  It's somewhere in the middle - native const numbers, for example, can't be re-assigned, but values in a const object or array can be... or at least, that's my first impression.  I also saw something about "freezing" objects, but that's out of my scope for a bit - there's much more learning to come.

Oh yes - I also noticed the enum (enumerated type) is missing, unfortunately, without rolling your own.  Despite pointing out so many differences, though - I've setup a web [site](https://stephen-montague.github.io/disasters-in-game-dev/) (like this one, but prettier) from scratch now in a few days, with HTML, CSS, and JS each running from a seperate source file, and it was, suprisingly, fairly user-friendly to figure out.  There's a wealth of great resources available, so this bodes well for what's to come.

Of course, it's also helpful to have live-coding demonstrations via Code Fellows. Kassie, if you're reading this - thank you much.
