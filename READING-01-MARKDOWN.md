Quick demo of adding a new page to a root source repo with YAML frontmatter.

In other words, I added a new [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) file to my GitHub repository that contains a few necessary header lines. 

If a classmate new to programming is browsing my site, I'd like to recommend [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) as a great source of information and problem-solving tips.  Read it carefully - these are generally posts by industry professionals - and among these, there's still need for weighing multiple perspectives and updates over time.  To be specific, for any topic - read several related questions and answers, with all comments - as much as you have time for, and through this you can gain a good perspective to start on any question.  

At Code Fellows, we also have recommended resources, like the [textbooks](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery-dp-1118907442/dp/1118907442/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) required for the next class.  I've bought my copy and look forward to digging into this more. :smirk::books:
