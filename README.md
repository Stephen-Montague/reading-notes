## Welcome to My Reading Notes 

This is a "GitHub Pages" site built via source README.md on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Stephen-Montague/reading-notes/) with a style theme from  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

These notes show the use of Markdown syntax, which can be used as a shortcut for formatting plain text, similar to using HTML, and in fact HTML is a compatible subset of Markdown. In my case, it's a decent place to start when reviewing the basics of Web Development.  While I have some experience in programming, Full Stack development hasn't been my focus until now, so I look forward to this journey.

### Growth Mindset

Code Fellows follows an intense program of study and practice in coding, but in the first days, the course instructors also suggest that we make a quick assessment of our mindset - here named a "Growth Mindset."  So what is a this?  In my mind, it's finding balance in all, most likely with daily effort, to do 2 things: 

1. Accept some limits
2. Push some limits  

Obivously, these 2 are opposed, hence why we always need to find some healthy, happy balance.

Health and happiness, action and rest... there's many things to balance, in any course of study.  

I look forward to completing the Code Fellows program with this in mind.

To demo more Markdown, here's a few quotes that show a tension between competing ideas held by the same person.

**George S. Patton 1885â€“1945**

> Take calculated risks. That is quite different from being rash. - *6 June 1944*
>  
> A good plan violently executed Now is better than a perfect plan next week. - *1947*

Just for the record, since this is a post where people may just be meeting me - I don't romanticize Patton or warfare to the degree that some have - careful balance is needed for all of our life stories.  We're all human.  Now, let's continue.
