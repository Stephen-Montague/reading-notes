# Welcome to My Reading Notes

I've joined Code Fellows for the next few months to meet wonderful people and get up to speed with Full Stack Web Development, and this repository is the source of a [site](https://stephen-montague.github.io/reading-notes/) for my reading notes.

Most content here is linked to the INDEX.md file.  

Work in Progress - feel free to chat with me about projects, or if you just want some fun - play this game I made in Unreal 4.27 [here](https://stephen-montague.itch.io/going-home).

Happy Coding.  :smiley:
