# Reading 6 - JavaScript 101

When you begin studying JavaScript for web development, likely in addition to HTML and CSS, even with a programming background in other C family languages, you see that this language has a very unique flavor, with numerous behaviors that surprised me.  I have some experience with C, Python, Java, and C++ yet there's something very different about JavaScript, which is hard to put my finger on exactly so far, but I can give some examples.  For one, the typing and comparison norms in JavaScript seem wild, even compared to Python, which is famous for flexibility.  In JavaScript, you can also call a function that doesn't exist, and it won't complain.  It will insert values however the just-in-time compiler sees fit and carry-on.  There seems to be few built-in protections that come standard to security-minded languages like Java, and yet, considering how widely used JavaScript is, I strongly suspect there's much more to come in this story.  I expect popular frameworks like React and Node will address very many of the seeming weaknesses or peculiarities of vanilla JavaScript.  In the mean time, it's been great fun to see what JavaScript can do in a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript environment.
