## Growth Mindset

Code Fellows follows an intense program of study and practice, but in the first days, we also make a quick assessment of our mindset - here named a "Growth Mindset."  So what is a this?  To me, it's finding balance in all, most likely with daily effort, to do 2 things:

1. Accept some limits
2. Push some limits  

Obivously, these 2 are opposed, hence why we always need to find some healthy, happy balance.  Health and happiness, action and rest - there's much to balance in any course of study.  

## Markdown Demo

To demo some [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), here's a few quotes with competing ideas held by the same person.

### George S. Patton 1885â€“1945

> Take calculated risks. That is quite different from being rash.  
> *6 June 1944*
>  
> A good plan violently executed Now is better than a perfect plan next week.  
> *1947*

[Oxford Quotations](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00016315)

Interestingly, I noticed that both the GitHub and Visual Studio previews of the quoted text above do **not** render exactly as on this site.  I plan to investigate when there's time.

As a side note, since this is a post where people may just be meeting me - I don't romanticize Patton or warfare to the degree that some have - careful balance is needed for all of our life stories.  We're all human, right? :robot::alien: Now, let's continue.

If a classmate new to programming is browsing my site, I'd like to recommend [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) as a great source of information and problem-solving tips.  Read it carefully - these are generally posts by industry professionals - and among these, there's still need for weighing multiple perspectives and updates over time.  To be specific, for any topic - read several related questions and answers, with all comments - as much as you have time for, and through this you can gain a good perspective to start on any question.  

At Code Fellows, we also have recommended resources, like the [textbooks](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery-dp-1118907442/dp/1118907442/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) required for the next class.  I've bought my copy and look forward to digging into this more. :smirk::books:

So to recap, this has been a quick demo of Markdown language and of adding a new page to a root source repo, [here](https://github.com/Stephen-Montague/reading-notes), as well as a few thoughts as I begin this course of study.
