# Reading 4 - HTML5

It's cool to see improvements in HTML programming over the years in terms of readibility and the tools used for development. One example of this is the emphasis on semantic elements in HTML5.

To be honest, though, the exact meaning of a semantic element, versus a non-semantic element, still eludes me - not the most important question to settle, but maybe worth a look.

The Mozilla [documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) on semantics do not provide an authoritative list of semantic elements, only a list of all elements, along with a few examples of semantic elements.

This [site](https://www.developerdrive.com/what-are-semantic-html-tags/) a well-written resource on web dev, claims that elements such as \<head> (not just \<header>) are semantic, but this had me re-taking a Code Fellows quiz, which did not agree.

Anyway, this shows the need, when in doubt, to consult an authoritative [source](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/). This is the standard for HTML5 - and an answer to these questions is there, if anywhere.

Besides some unresolved questions, I can clearly see that common semantic elements would be very useful in place of old methods that relied on user-generated div classes and such.

It's such as pleasure to have well-though-out coding languages and resources like modern IDE's with near-live previewing and the ability to publish new sites for free so quickly.

It seems a central question creators face nowadays is not "Can we create" but "What should we create?" - at least, relating to the output of light and sound from a computer. Sometimes, we see so many special FX we begin to think scientists have nearly conquered every problem, but that is certainly not true.

There's much work to be done.
