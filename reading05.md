# Reading 5 - CSS

CSS really stretches the mind, forcing you to think of general rules to describe formating, rather than  relying on hard-coded solutions.  In the end this is a great way to make websites responsive to all kinds of content and media devices. A website with only HTML would likely look very primitive, but with competent CSS added, the results could feel modern and professional, although the site would be fairly static in capability.  Adding actions / capability tends to be the domain of JavaScript, the learning of which is the next step in our learning path here at Code Fellows.
